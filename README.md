# ATHLETIVENTURE

Atletiventure is a community-based fitness app and game. Real people create a "character" profile and complete workouts and challenges from real fitness professionals online. Users are able to add their own workouts that they love, try new ones and see the most popular workouts. They are also able to track their progress through completing a weekly schedule, earning points and logging their weight changes.

## Site

Here is a link to the live site:

## Wireframes and Design

My design ideas were formulated by thinking about how to engage users to continue to use the app and to make progress. I leaned into the idea of an adventure-game or computer-game type interaction where you could accumulate points, increase your level and upgrade your avatar as an incentive. 

Going with this idea, a lot of the games that came to mind had dark undertones with bright flashes of color - post-apocalyptical inspiration with Tron, Altered Carbon, Dreamfall (computer game).

For the user profile, I wanted to base it off of feeling like you are viewing a character profile in a computer game - similar to World of Warcraft (pictured below).
